===============
=: Your Game :=
===============

- What game are you planning to implement? If it is a game of your own design,
  or not especially well-known, provide a 2-3 sentence description of the game.
  
  
  My idea for the game is that there will be many shapes showing up in the screen, and clicking on
  them will make them disappear and you will get points for it. However, the shapes will disappear
  after a while so you got to click fast, and some shapes might require more than one clicks to 
  get the points.
  


- What classes and interfaces do you plan to create? How will the different
  components of your game (the model, the GUI, etc.) interact?
  
  First of all, I need to make all the different shapes (circle, triangle, square, star). I also
  need a main method to run the game, which is provided already in the sample code given to us. 
  Lastly, I need to a gamecourt class where I will assemble all the pieces together.
  
  Interfaces and classes that I will implement include: jpanel, jframe, jcomponent, runnable, 
  gameobject, reader, and writer. First I will have the outer jframe, then I will add all the 
  jpanels inside with the game state shown on the top of the frame, the highest score shown 
  on the bottom of the frame, and the gamecourt in the middle of the frame. Within the gamecourt,
  I will have various shapes spawn at set intervals and create actionlisteners corresponding to
  all those shapes which will update the current score if all the shape is clicked. A timer is 
  needed such that the shapes will disappear over time. If a black coloreded object is clicekd,
  then the player loses ponts. To keep track of the highest score, I also
  need to create a txt file and whenever a game is played the score will be written down on the 
  text file and before the next game, the highest score will be updated based on the highest 
  number in the txt file.


- What do you think will be the most challenging thing to implement?

I'm still fairly new to java, and I think the most challenging thing for me to do will be to
learn how everything fit together and know how to fit everything together as well. I did not fully
understand the paint homework so I need to catch up a lot on this one.



====================
=: Core Concept 1 :=
====================

Concept 1: ___Using I/O to parse a novel file format.____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?

This concept will be used mainly to keep track of all the scores and update the high scores 
accordingly. When storing the high scores, I will not simply write numbers down on the txt file,
I will also add the player's name next to it.




- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.
  
In a game, it makes sense for the user to know the current top score, which can provide a 
motivation for the player. High scores is implemented in almost all the common games though in
many different forms.
  
  


====================
=: Core Concept 2 :=
====================

Concept 2: ___Appropriately modeling state using 2-D arrays or collections____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?

In order to randomly generate shapes, I am planning on using the random number generator. I will be 
using a 3-D array for my game implementation. The first argument will be the number of horizontal 
pixels, and the second argument will be the number of vertical pixels. The third argument would be
a treeset of shapes to put within a that location. 

- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.
  
I am doing this because in my game, multiple shapes might overlap in the same location if 
the random number generator generates the same indexes.
Therefore, I need a 3-D array to do this.
  
I believe using a random number generator paired up with arrays is a fast method to generate the 
random objects that I want. 
====================
=: Core Concept 3 :=
====================

Concept 3: ___Object-oriented design using inheritance and subtyping____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?

There are some obvious interfaces such as runnable and that I will use to extend upon them.
Also, I plane on creating many other shapes extending the gameobject class.


- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.

It makes sense because for example, squares, triangles are all certain types of gameobjects but 
more specified. They must include methods included in the gameobject class and perhaps adding some
more. Therefore, it makes sense to use inheritance and substyping here.


====================
=: Core Concept 4 :=
====================

Concept 4: ___Using JUnit to test some features of your model____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?

I will be implementing this concept when testing my gamecourt methods to make sure that they are
correct and functional. Some sample methods that I will be testing include: if current score
is registered in the text file, if high score retrieving method works, does the current score 
increases if a correct object is clicked, and if the current score decreases if a dark object is 
clicked.



- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.

Everyone makes mistakes while coding so it makes sense to derive some sort of method to test your
code and debug. In my game in particular, the score keeping is a function that I can thoroughly 
test and make sure that it functions correctly.
